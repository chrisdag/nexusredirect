<h1>Nexus has moved</h1>
<p>If you see this page, you are accessing the old Nexus URL.
  The Nexus server was moved to the production Openshift VPC in recognition
  of it's importance to Syngenta operations and CI/CD automation. The secondary
  reason for the move is that the USAE-2 Openshift environment needed to be emptied
  of running services in order to support a planned rebuild and upgrade effort.
</p>

<p>New Nexus URL: <a href="https://nexus.apps.usae-1.syngentaaws.org">https://nexus.apps.usae-1.syngentaaws.org</a></p>
<p>New Docker Public Registry URL: <a href="https://registry.usae-1.syngentaaws.org">https://registry.usae-1.syngentaaws.org</a></p>

<p> The migration happened in November 2019 but we kept Nexus online here in
  read-only mode to support a longer transition period. </p>

<p>For Nexus related questions ask a question under the CE project at https://jira.syngentaaws.org or
  contact Chris Dagdigian (dag@bioteam.net) directly. Thanks!</p>
